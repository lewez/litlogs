## A simplistic and extensible Garry's Mod logging addon ##

Built for DarkRP but it can support other gamemodes if given the appropriate changes.
Requires MySQLOO; set your database details in lua/litlogs/sv_litlogs-sql.lua.

Disclaimer: This addon was created a while ago, it is unlikely that it will be updated.
